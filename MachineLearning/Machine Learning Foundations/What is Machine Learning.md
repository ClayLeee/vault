### From Learning to Machine Learning
- learning: acquiring ==skill== with experience accumulated from ==observations==
	> observations -> learning -> skill
- machine learning: acquiring ==skill== with experience accumulated/==computed== from ==data==
	> data -> ML -> skill

### A More Concrete Definition
- skill: improve some ==performance measure== (e.g. prediction accuracy)
- machine learning: improving some ==preformance measure== with experience ==computed== from ==data==
  > data -> ML -> improved preformance measure

e.g. An Application in Computational Finance
> stock data -> ML -> more investment gain

e.g. Tree Recognition
- 'define' trees and hand-program: ==difficult==
- learn from data(observations) and recognize: a ==3-year-old== can do so
- 'ML-based tree recognition system' can be ==easier to build== than hand-programmed system

### The Machine Learning Route
ML: an ==alternative route== to build complicated systems

#### Some Use Scenarios
- when human cannot program the system manually -> ==navigating on Mars==
- when human cannot 'define the solution' easily -> ==speech / visual recognition==
- when needing rapid decisions that humans cannot do -> ==high-frequency trading==
- when needing to be user-oriented in a massive scale -> ==consumer-targeted marketing==

> teach it how to fish, you feed it for a lifetime.

### Key Essence of Machine Learning(help decide whether to use ML)
1. exists ==some 'underlying pattern' to be learned== -> so 'performance measure' can be improved
2. but ==no== programmable(easy) ==definition== -> so 'ML' is needed
3. somehow there is ==data== about the pattern -> so ML has some 'inputs' to learn from

### Quiz
Which of the following is best suited for machine learning?
- a. predicting whether the next cry of the baby girl happens at an even-numbered minute or not
- b. determining whether a given graph contains a cycle
- c. deciding whether to approve credit card to some customer
- d. guessing whether the earth will be destroyed by the misuse of nuclear power in the next ten years

Answer: c
a. no pattern
b. programmable definition
c. pattern: customer behavior
	definition: not easily programmable
	data: history of bank operation
d. arguably no(or not enough) data yet
