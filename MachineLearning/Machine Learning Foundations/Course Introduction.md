### Machine Learning
- a mixture of theoretical and practical tools
	- Theory oriented
		- derive everything deeply for solid understanding
		- less interesting to general audience
	- Techniques oriented
		- flash over the sexiest techniques broadly for shiny coverage
		- too many techniques, hard to choose, hard to use properly
- Foundation Oriented ML Course
	- mixture of philosophical illustrations, key theory, core techniques, usage in practice, and hopefully jokes -> what ==every machine learning user== should know
	- story-like
		- ==When== can Machines Learn? (illustrative + technical)
			- [Course Introduction](Course%20Introduction.md)
			- [What is Machine Learning](What%20is%20Machine%20Learning.md)
			- [Applications of Machine Learning](Applications%20of%20Machine%20Learning.md)
			- [Components of Machine Learning](Components%20of%20Machine%20Learning.md)
			- [Machine Learning and Other Fields](Machine%20Learning%20and%20Other%20Fields.md)
		- ==Why== can Machines Learn? (theoretical + illustrative)
		- ==How== can Machines Learn? (technical + practical)
		- How can Machines Learn ==Better==? (practical + theoretical)

### Course History
- 8 weeks of Foundation + 7 weeks of techniques
