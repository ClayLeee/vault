In the [previous lesson](22.%20Create%20React%20App%20-%20React-Scripts%201.md), we know that there are four scripts inside the package.json. In this lesson we are going to dive into the three remaining scripts.
### Start
 It will take all of the files that we have written for our React application and it will ==run them in a local development environment==

### Build
What the build step does is to ==make our code much more optimized== so that it's as ==small and efficiently served as possible==. It's trying to create the most optimal low memory version of our application

### Test
Tests are just ways for us to make sure that the code we write for our React application does what we expect it to

App.test.js -> for testing App.js
```jsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
import App from './App';

test('renders learn react link', () => {
	render(<App />);
	const linkElement = screen.getByText(/learn react/i);
	expect(linkElement).toBeInTheDocument();
});
```
### Eject
The browser doesn't understand what we write in our React project. So what's happening is that in this build process(eject) there is actually two libraries being used or two packages:
	- [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Babel-F9DC3E?style=for-the-badge&logo=babel&logoColor=white" alt="babel" />](https://babeljs.io/) -> what Babel does is it takes all of our React code that we've written, and it condenses it down into this ==Javascript that browsers can understand==
	- [<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Webpack-8DD6F9?style=for-the-badge&logo=Webpack&logoColor=white" alt="webpack" />](https://webpack.js.org/) -> under ==build/static/js==, there are a lot of ==chunks==. A chunk is essentially a contained ==portion of Javascript code== that is working together to actually represent a part of our application. When the user is trying to access the home page, he just gets the Javascript related to the home page.So Webpack is essentially modularized our code module being a chunk.
Babel and Webpack are tools. That means you can modify them so that they ==follow some specific rules that you want to create==. If you want to modify it for your project needs and concerns, you can ==EJECT==.

### Others Basic Files in Project
#### setupTests.js
-> just a file that really just imports the specfic testing library

#### favicon.ico
-> just the icon in the tab of your browser
#### logo192.png & logo512.png
-> just different size logos

#### manifest.json
-> the file is a way for us to actually be ==progressive web app(PWA)== compliant, and all this means PWA is that ==some people want to be able to download your web application onto their desktop== so that they can ==access it offline==. 

So essentially with the logos like logo192.png, you can create this little icon of your choice, which is what these logos will be inside of this contain PWA application that they download from the website onto their desktop. 

And then that logo is what they double click to actually open your progressive web app version of your website.

#### robots.txt
-> this file is just telling web scrapers which is ==SEO== related. 

So like Google, for example, when they determine whether they need to rank your website higher or lower, it crawls your website with their own kind of like code crawlers.
