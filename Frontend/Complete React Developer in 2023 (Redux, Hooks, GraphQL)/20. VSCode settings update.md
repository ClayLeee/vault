There's been a recent VSCode update that changed how folders stack when you have just one file in a folder. This may be confusing to see for some students!

If you want VSCode to return to normal behaviour before this update, you can change this settings by going to File -> Preferences -> Settings -> Features then unchecking Compact Folders.
