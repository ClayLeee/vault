In this lesson, we are going to familiar with what React as a library works so that you understand what JSX is doing compared to what you would have to do if you didn't have JSX

- Here we really saw a little bit more of a verbose example of how we're created two different components, both our App component and our Person component, and how we can leverage React to actually put these elements on the page
- ==JSX== just ==simplifies this entire process==, but we're still writing ==functional components==, everything else about these components is exactly ==the same==, JSX just looks a lot more ==readable==

app.js
```js
const Person = props => {
	return React.createElement('div', {}, [
		React.createElement('h1', { key: 1 }, props.name),
		React.createElement('p', { key: 2 }, props.occupation)
	]);
};

const App = () => {
	return React.createElement('div', {}, [
		React.createElement('h1', { className: 'title', key: 3 }, 'React IS rendered'),
		React.createElement(Person, { name: 'Clay', occupation: 'front-end developer', key: 4 }, null),
		React.createElement(Person, { name: 'Andrei', occupation: 'lead instructor', key: 5 }, null),
		React.createElement(Person, { name: 'Emily', occupation: 'teacher', key: 6 }, null),
	]);
};

ReactDOM.render(
	React.createElement(App),
	document.getElementById('root')
);
```

index.html
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
	<meta charset="UTF-8">
	<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

</head>

<body>
	<div id="root">React is NOT rendered</div>
	<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18.0.0-rc.0/umd/react.development.js"></script>
	<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18.0.0-rc.0/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
	<script src="./app.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

> Now that we understand what React and React DOM do for us as libraries, it's much easier now moving forward for us to just leverage JSX to wtire our code
