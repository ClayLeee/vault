### Javascript Functions
- As we know with a function, a function is supposed to iterate from top to bottom, meaning that Javascript runs from top to bottom

### useState
- `useState` essentially gives us an ability to encapsulate local state in a functional component
- The first value is going to be ==the value that we want to store==, and the second value is going to be a ==set== or ==function==

```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import CardList from './components/card-list/card-list.component';
import SearchBox from './components/search-box/search-box.component';
import './App.css';

const App = () => {
	const [ searchField, setSearchField ] = useState('');
	console.log(searchField);
	
	const onSearchChange = (event) => {
		const searchFieldString = event.target.value.toLocaleLowerCase();
		setSearchField(searchFieldString);
	}
	return (
		<div className="App">
			<h1 className="app-title">Monsters Rolodex</h1>
			<SearchBox
				className="search-box"
				onChangeHandler={ onSearchChange }
				placeholder="search monsters"
			/>
			{/* <CardList monsters={filteredMonsters} /> */}
		</div>
	)
}

export default App;
```

After modifying the code, we input `1234` and then delete the input, the `searchField` value will be like this
