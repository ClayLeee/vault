### Try to sign in with Redirect
firebase.utils.js
```js
import { signInWithRedirect } from 'firebase/auth';

+ export const signInWithGoogleRediect = () => signInWithRedirect(auth, googleProvider);
```

sign-in.component.jsx
```jsx
import { signInWithGoogleRedirect } from '../../utils/firebase/firebase.utils';

const SignIn = () => {
	...
+	const logGoogleRedirectUser = async () => {
+		const { user } = await signInWithGoogleRedirect();
+		console.log(user);
+	}

	return (
		<div>
			<h1>Sign In Page</h1>
			<button onClick={ logGoogleUser }>
				Sign In with Google Popup
			</button>
+			<button onClick={ logGoogleRedirectUser }>
+				Sign In with Google Redirect
+			</button>
		</div>
	);
};
```

When you try to login now, you'll find that we can't get the `user` from line 7 in sign-in component
What happened is when we came back from redirecting, we essentially reinitialize our entire application from the start of scratch, meaning that any previously held functions that we were perhaps in the middle of doesn't matter anymore

For that reason, we need to use a different way in order to actually track this type of information

sign-in.component.jsx
```jsx
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { getRedirectResult } from 'firebase/auth';
import { auth } from '../../utils/firebase/firebase.utils';

const SignIn = () => {
+	useEffect(() => {
+		async function getResult() {
+			const response = await getRedirectResult(auth);
+			if (response) {
+				const userdocRef = await createUserDocumentFromAuth(response.user);
+			}
+		}
+		getResult();
+	}, []);

	return (
		<div>
			...
			<button onClick={ signInWithGoogleRedirect }>
				Sign In with Google Redirect
			</button>
		</div>
	);
}
```
When you click sign in button, you will redirect to another page for selecting a google account to login, 
And then when you redirect back to your app, once your app re-mounts, you can get the `response` from the `getRedirectResult` function
So the `user` collection will be created again through the `createUserDocumentFromAuth` function
