### Functional Component
1. No constructor, no life cycle methods, no render
2. Functional Components are ==pure function==, meaning that all React is going to fo is run this function ==from top to bottom==
3. A React functional component takes arguments that are the ==props== of this component and then it ==returns JSX==
4. Functional components do not go through life cycles

```jsx
const App = () => {
	return (
		...
	)
}
```

### Class Component
1. Needs constructor, needs life cycle methods, needs render

```jsx
class App extends Component {
	constructor() {
		...
	}
	componentDidMount() {
		...
	}
	render() {
		return (
			...
		)
	}
}
```

### Side effects & Pure function
You have to think about it in a completely different way, and the way you want to think about them is in the concept of functions and side effects.

In order for us to understand ==side effects==, we need to understand ==pure functions== and ==impure functions== which we'll cover in the next lesson.

The reason why you need to know about functions, pure functions, impure functions and side effects is because in order for us to ==replicate all of the behavior that we had in our class components== with `state` and with `set state` and with `life cycle methods`, we need to understand this idea of side effects.
