Optional: filter(), includes()

If you are new to the concept of using the `filter() or includes()`  we saw in the previous video and you would like to learn more, we created a bonus video to explain array methods in more detail. Simply go to **Appendix 1: Key Developer Concepts** at the bottom of the course video player, and watch the video titled _filter()_ and _includes()_ .  
  
Otherwise, let's keep going to the next video :)
