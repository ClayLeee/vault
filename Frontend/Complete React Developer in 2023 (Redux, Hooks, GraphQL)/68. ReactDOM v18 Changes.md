We are already calling React 18 and inside of the application code you'll notice that you see the warning that React DOM render is not support

### Use CreateRoot instead
React 17
```js
ReactDOM.render(
	React.createElement(App),
	document.getElementById('root')
);
```
React 18
```js
const container = document.getElementById('root');
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(container);
root.render(React.createElement(App));
```
After refreshing, we see that our code works and we've gotten rid of that warning
