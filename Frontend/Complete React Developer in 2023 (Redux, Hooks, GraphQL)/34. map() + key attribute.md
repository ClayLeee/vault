A good rule of thumb as to when to use the **key** attribute you saw in the previous video, is this: _Anytime you use the_ `_map()_` _function inside of render, or you have a list of the same jsx elements one after another, they need a key attribute (and CRA will warn you about it if you miss it)_  
  
If you are new to the concept of using the `map()` function we saw in the previous video and you would like to learn more, we created a bonus video to explain the function in more detail. Simply go to **Appendix 1: Key Developer Concepts** at the bottom of the course video player, and watch the video on the `map()` function.  
  
Otherwise, let's keep going to the next video :)
