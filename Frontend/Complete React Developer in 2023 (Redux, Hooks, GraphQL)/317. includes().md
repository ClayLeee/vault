### Includes
#### Primitive type
- [MDN Includes()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/includes)
```js
const myArray = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

myArray.includes(3)
-> true

myArray.includes(9)
-> false

myArray.includes(2, 3)
-> false

myArray.includes(2, 1)
-> true
```

#### Non Primitive type
- If we do the `includes` to find the object in an array, we will get false because Javascript stores the non primitive value in different memory although they are looking the same
```js
const newArray = [{ id: 1 }, { id: 2 }, { id: 3 }]
newArray.includes({ id: 2 })
-> false
```

- The elements inside the array are not new objects, but they're all ==pointing to the same elements in memory==, which is why when we do the `includes`, the evaluation is true
- It's checking if the reference that we're passing in is equal to the any of the elements inside by their ==memory reference==
```js
const o1 = { id: 1 }
const o2 = { id: 2 }
const o3 = { id: 3 }
const newArray = [ o1, o2, o3 ]

newArray.includes(o1)
-> true
```
