> UI, The rest is up to you.

1. React only cares about this whole idea of components and virtual DOM.We are only going to work with the view, the user interface, everything else that you need.
2. You can just use other modules, other libraries and mix and match and have whatever you want customized to your need.
3. [React native](https://reactnative.dev/)  -> for Android, iOS, and more using React
   [React Desktop](https://reactdesktop.js.org/) -> for desktop application
   [React blessed](https://github.com/Yomguithereal/react-blessed) -> work with the terminal and command prompt
   [React 360](https://reactresources.com/topics/react-360) -> for VR apps
