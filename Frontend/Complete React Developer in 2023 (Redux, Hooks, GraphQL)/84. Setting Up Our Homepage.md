### Think about what we want to break up?
- The directory component primarily lives on the ==home page==, which is the page that you have when you land on the website
- There's also a ==shop page== which will render this directory of all of the different collections
- We also know that deeper down we have another further ==library page== that contains the products for a related category
- The ==navigation bar== should always persist no matter what different page you navigate to

### Wrap the Entire Application in Router Component
We've wrapped our application component inside of our `BrowserRouter` component, we can access all of the different features that come in React Router DOM specific to this `BrowserRouter` that is now going to control all of routing inside of our nested application
index.js
```jsx
import { BrowserRouter } from 'react-router-dom';
...

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
	<React.StrictMode>
		<BrowserRouter>
			<App />
		</BrowserRouter>
	</React.StrictMode>
);
...
```

### Set up a Route component
Routes is a folder that will hold all of our route, top level components
```shell
.routes
└── ./home
    └── ./home/home.component.jsx
```
home.component.jsx
```jsx
import Directory from '../../components/directory/directory.component.jsx';

const Home = () => {
	const categories = [
		{
			id: 1,
			title: 'hats',
			imageUrl: 'https://i.ibb.co/cvpntL1/hats.png'
		},
		{
			id: 2,
			title: 'jackets',
			imageUrl: 'https://i.ibb.co/px2tCc3/jackets.png'
		},
		{
			'id': 3,
			'title': 'sneakers',
			'imageUrl': 'https://i.ibb.co/0jqHpnp/sneakers.png'
		},
		{
			'id': 4,
			'title': 'womens',
			'imageUrl': 'https://i.ibb.co/GCCdy8t/womens.png'
		},
		{
			'id': 5,
			'title': 'mens',
			'imageUrl': 'https://i.ibb.co/R70vBrQ/men.png'
		}
	]

	return (
		<Directory categories={ categories } />
	);
};

export default Home;
```
Use `Routes` & `Route` to assemble the routing at our application level, and it allows this application to register these route level components that will then in turn render a ==specific component== when it matches this ==specific route==
App.js
```jsx
import { Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './routes/home/home.component.jsx';

const App = () => {
	return (
		<Routes>
			<Route path='/home' element={ <Home /> }/>
		</Routes>
	);
};

export default App;
```
