> Don't touch the DOM. I'll do it.

### DOM
- treelike constructure
- it's what the browser uses to display a Web Site, and ==Javascript== is simply manipulating this DOM.

### Imperative
- You directly change individual parts of your app in response to various user events.
- ex: JQuery

### Declarative
- Just tell me what the page should look like. 
  I'll do everything for you.
  I'll find the best way to use the DOM.
  You're never going to touch the DOM.
- ex: React, 
  React came up with a novel concept a more declarative approach.
