### Asynchronously update
In the last lesson, we see the value doesn't change after we click the button. It's because ==React updates all the changes asychronously==

### Recommeded method for setState
There are two parameters of the first return value, and both are optional:
1. state
2. props
```jsx
this.setState(
	(state, props) => {
		return { ... }
	},
	() => {...}
);
```

There are two returns for setState:
1. the value you want to update the state
2. callback function which means what you want to do after updating
```jsx
<button onClick={() => {
	this.setState(
		() => {
			return {
				name: { firstName: 'Andrei', lastName: 'Neaogie' }
			}
		},
		() => {
			console.log(this.state);
		}
	);
}}>
	Change Name
</button>
```

You can see the correct updating value now
