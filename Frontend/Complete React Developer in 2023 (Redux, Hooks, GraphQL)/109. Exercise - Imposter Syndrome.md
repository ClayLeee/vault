### Imposter Syndrome
- It's the idea that you're not good enough that things are too complicated for you to ever achieve what you want to achieve
- This idea of you not being good enough simply means that, `you're just not there yet`
- But over time, with repetition, with practice, you get comfortable, you get experience, and you slowly start to lose that imposter syndrome
- This idea of an imposter syndrome is great, it means `you're doing something good`, that `you're learning`, and `you're stretching your limits`
- Yoda is pretty perfect
