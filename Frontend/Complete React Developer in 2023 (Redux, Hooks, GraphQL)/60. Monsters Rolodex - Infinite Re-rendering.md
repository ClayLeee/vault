### Card List component
Let's actually migrate out what we have left inside of this component, which is the card list
```jsx
import { useState } from 'react';
import CardList from './components/card-list/card-list.component';
import SearchBox from './components/search-box/search-box.component';
import './App.css';

const App = () => {
	const [ searchField, setSearchField ] = useState('');
	const [ monsters, setMonsters ] = useState([]);

	console.log('render');
  
	fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
		.then((response) => response.json())
		.then((users) => setMonsters(users)
	);

	const onSearchChange = (event) => {
		const searchFieldString = event.target.value.toLocaleLowerCase();
		setSearchField(searchFieldString);
	};

	const filteredMonsters = monsters.filter((monster) => {
		return monster.name.toLocaleLowerCase().includes(searchField);
	});

	return (
		<div className="App">
			<h1 className="app-title">Monsters Rolodex</h1>
			<SearchBox
				className="search-box"
				onChangeHandler={ onSearchChange }
				placeholder="search monsters"
			/>
			<CardList monsters={ filteredMonsters } />
		</div>
	)
}

export default App;
```

### Functional Component has no `componentDidMount`
In this lesson, we just focus on and discuss the part below.
In the Class Component, we have the life cycle `componentDidMount` to fetch data. But in the Functional Component, there is no `componentDidMount`.
```jsx
const App = () => {
	console.log('render');
  
	fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
		.then((response) => response.json())
		.then((users) => setMonsters(users)
	);
}
```
If we try to fetch data and `setMonsters` in `App()` without using `useEffect` which we will talk about at next lesson, there will be ==infinite `render`== on the browser.

So why did that happen?

Whenever the state updates, if there's a ==different value for the state value== as there was in the previous state, then it will ==re-render==.
In our particular case, it is the user's array. This array, because it comes from outside of our browser, it is going to give us an array that is ==different in memory== than the one that we have stored. 
Because of this, React thinks it's going to be a different array and it will update the component again and again.
