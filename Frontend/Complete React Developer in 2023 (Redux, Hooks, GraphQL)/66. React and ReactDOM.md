So far we really used a lot of the syntactic sugar meaning the much more easy way to write React using jsx, but in order for us to get a good idea of how the React and React DOM libraries actually work. It's easier if we just learn about both these libraries from scratch

### Use Pure React & React DOM instead of using JSX
- [React library](https://unpkg.com/react@18.0.0-rc.0/umd/react.development.js): engine React does defying, optimizations, and determining what to render and how 
- [React DOM](https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18.0.0-rc.0/umd/react-dom.development.js): determines what we're trying to render to specifically React DOM renders to the DOM

1. create a file
	```shell
	-> mkdir pure-react
	-> cd pure-react
	-> touch index.html
	-> code .
	```
2. select `html:5` to create a quick template for HTML
	```html
	html:5
	```
3. use React & React DOM to build a simple APP
	```js
	<!DOCTYPE html>
	<html lang="en">
	<head>
		<meta charset="UTF-8">
		<meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
		<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
		<title>Document</title>
	</head>
	
	<body>
		<div id="root">React is NOT rendered</div>
		<script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18.0.0-rc.0/umd/react.development.js"></script>
		<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18.0.0-rc.0/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script>
		<script>
			const App = () => {
				return React.createElement('div', {}, [
					React.createElement('h1', { class: 'title' }, 'React IS rendered'),
				]);
			};
	  
			ReactDOM.render(
				React.createElement(App),
				document.getElementById('root')
			);
		</script>
	</body>
	</html>
	```
4. Now we can see the change!

### P.S. CreateElement
```js
const element = createElement(type, props, ...children)
```

>It is ==easier== for us to ==write JSX== which looks like HTML and absorbs and takes in JS variables rather than constantly writing this verbose create element where we define what we're looking for, then the attributes and then the children.
>So this is how React and React DOM work as base libraries
