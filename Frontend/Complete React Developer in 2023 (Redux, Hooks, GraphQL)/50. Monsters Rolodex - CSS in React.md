### Css in React
- When you import a CSS file, the CSS file is going to be ==applicable to the entire website==
- The only reason why we put these imports at the component level is more so for us ==when we are looking for our styling that is related to the component==. You want to put it where that component lives and of course you want to target your CSS

### Examples
card-list.component.jsx
```jsx
<div className="card-list">...</div>
```
search-box.styles.css
```css
...
.card-list {
	background: red;
}
```

If you add a className `card-list` on the parent `div` of the component CardList, but add the CSS in the SearchBox CSS file. You can see the CSS is still applying to the CardList
