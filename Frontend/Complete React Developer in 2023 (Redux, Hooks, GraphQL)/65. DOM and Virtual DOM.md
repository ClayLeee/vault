- If you open up our inspect and inside of here we have our ==HTML layout==, what this represents is actually a tree of element or a ==DOM tree==(Document Object Model)
- The three elements inside the top level app are ==siblings== to each other because they are ==at the same level==
  1. h1
  2. input
  3. div
- The thing about the real DOM is that it's actually really ==expensive in order to make changes==, like the ==reflow==, so we don't want to needlessly do that if we don't have to(JQuery to Frontend framework)

### How React handle the DOM make it a good solution?
![](./canvas/Real%20DOM%20&%20Virtual%20DOM.canvas)
1. React reflects all of the elements in ==Javascript== and makes a ==duplicate copy== of the real DOM as a ==snapshot== which called ==virtual DOM==, and the process is called ==reflow==
2. React makes another copy of the ==virtual DOM==
3. The changes are in turn going to call set state inside our app., and React will re-render all of the HTML and the JSX through the virtual DOM, from top to bottom.==Mounting== is the phase where you're pulling things off of the DOM
4. React compares this ==virtual DOM copy== against the ==virtual DOM snapshot== and it's going to highlight where things and different
5. Once it figures out where those differences are, it's going to actually make those changes onto the ==real DOM==.In the end, the user can actually see these final changes

> It's a pretty lengthy process, but that's really all the virtual DOM is doing.
> The reason it does this is because ==pulling off== and ==changing these different nodes== on a ==real DOM== is ==expensive==.
> It's ==easier== to do it in ==Javascript== and save when React is finally supposed to be reflected onto the real DOM, it will then actually make those changes.
> React has a bunch of different optimizations that it does under the hood by batching some of these calls together in order to make this process more efficient.
