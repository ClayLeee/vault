> Unidirectional data flow.

1. React is a Javascript library that allows us to wtire more Javascript to have interactivity on our website.
2. React has state which you can think of it as a JS object that describes our app.
	```js
	let state = {
		user: 'Clay Lee',
		isLoggedIn: true,
		friends: ['Pavel', 'Matt', 'Joy']
	}
	```
3. You can use the state to build your components.
4. State + Components = JSX
	```html
	const element = (
		<div>
			<h1>Hello</h1>
			<h2>Good to see you here.</h2>
		</div>
	)   
	```
5. VirtualDOM is the blueprint which tells React how it should render the actual DOM.
6. The most important of all, the data only ==flows one way==.
