Hello everyone!

Just a quick note to remember to use the back tick  `` ` `` and NOT regular single or double quotes (`'` and `"`) for string interpolation on our image `src`. This is an easy mistake to make as you cannot interpolate the strings when using regular quotes, you must use back ticks!

Happy coding!
