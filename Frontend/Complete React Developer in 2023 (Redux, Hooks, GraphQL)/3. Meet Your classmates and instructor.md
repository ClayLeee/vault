#### **1. Before we get started, let's do a quick exercise that will take less than 3 minutes:**

**Step 1** - Click on this link to join our Private Online Classroom: [**CLICK HERE TO JOIN NOW**](https://discord.gg/MxEYsksyyJ)**.**
  
**Step 2 -** Once inside, go to **#introductions** channel and share who you are, where you are from, and why you chose to do this course.  
  
**Step 3 -** Go to the **#accountability-buddies** and find a buddy who is starting a ZTM course today just like you _(doesn't have to be the same course)_! You will be keeping each other accountable throughout the course and motivating each other to finish. Who knows, maybe you will find life long friends/coworkers this way.   

**Step 4 -** check out **#general** or your course specific channel to meet others in your class. We will be announcing class hangouts and instructor meetups/livestreams in there. Some of the channels available for you to join are:
  
**#react -** _For all ReactJS questions_
**#alumni -** _Ask graduates of this course questions_
**#womenintech -** _For the female coders out there_
**#job-hunting -** _Anything related to finding a job as a developer_

_....and many many more!!_

**OPTIONAL Step -** A fellow ZTM student, Matt, has made a video walkthrough for you of the community [**here**](https://youtu.be/TVI_MBoCOak) if you want to watch and take a deep dive as to all the things that happen in the community every month.  

#### **2. Course updates and cheatsheets?**

We are constantly adding new videos and updating this course, announcing new community events, and creating course cheatsheets/resources. To stay up to date with all the latest changes to the course and new videos, keep an eye out on the **#announcements** channel in our Discord community. Anything important will be announced in there _(you can scroll to see past announcements)_.

**You can also follow me on twitter where I keep you updated about industry news, upcoming courses, and random thoughts on life:** [**@andreineagoie**](https://twitter.com/AndreiNeagoie) **and** [**@zerotomasteryio**](https://twitter.com/zerotomasteryio)  

#### **3. One more thing...**
  
As you start the course, Udemy will have a popup that  will ask you to leave a review ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ of the course. Yes, it can get a little annoying _(it's a Udemy system and not something we have control over)_ but please leave an honest review _(even if you just started the course)_ as it really helps us out and allows more people to discover this course in this massively competitive marketplace. It would truly mean a lot 😊.

Thank you and welcome to ZTM!!
