### Rendering & Re-rendering in React
- Components will render based on ==two conditions== when ==`setState` gets called== and when ==props are updated==
- React will render by ==component tree== from top down which is going to run the component's contructor. It will render from parent component, and then any subsequent children are going to do the same thing
- Component tree is the idea where the top of the tree is your parent component, and then each level down is any children that there are and subsequent children and subsequent children and etc...

### Examples
card-list.component.jsx
```jsx
import { Component } from 'react';

class CardList extends Component {
	render() {
		console.log(this.props.monsters);
		console.log('render from Cardlist');
		const { monsters } = this.props;
		return (
			<div>
				{ monsters.map((monster) => (
					<h1 key={ monster.id }>{ monster.name }</h1>
				))}
			</div>
		);
	}
}

export default CardList;
```

Result:

The component will re-render when the Props are updated, and then we can get the monsters list
