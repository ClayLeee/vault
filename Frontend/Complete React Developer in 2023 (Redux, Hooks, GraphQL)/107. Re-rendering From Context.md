### Context causes Performance Problem?
sign-up-form.component.jsx
```jsx
import { useState, useContext } from 'react';
import { UserContext } from '../../contexts/user.context';

const SignUpForm = () => {
	...
	const val = useContext(UserContext);
	console.log('hit');
	...
}
```

1. The initial `hit` value comes from our `sign-up-form` component
2. When I sign in to my user and the provider updates, the second `hit` gets called again

The fact is that React will `rerun` `sign-up-form` component before the `return(JSX)` which means it doesn't actually re-render anything on the DOM
However, If you have hundreds of components that are all hooked into a `context`, it could be a `performance problem`
