### Add React Router

### Updating & Upgrading Libraries
- The package maintainers may be having some kind of ==conflict== between a lot of ==different versions== that they're supporting
- A lot of times these libraries are heavily dependent upon by the majority of different applications in production that rely on them, so there's a lot of heavy decision making they have to make when rolling out major versions, especially ones that have sweeping breaking changes like React Router v5 to v6
