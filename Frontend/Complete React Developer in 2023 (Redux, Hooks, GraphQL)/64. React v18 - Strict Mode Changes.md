### React Strict Mode
- ==React Strict Mode== is a way that ==enforces that we don't use any deprecated methods== that are going to get deprecated from React
- React 18 is no longer suppressing the fact that it actually ==double renders your components== in order to ==try and catch any weird behaviors== that might occur in your side effects inside of your functional components

### React Developer Tools
- Download [React Developer Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi) which is a Chrome extension for your Chrome browser that allows you to actually see what this is happening

If you type in `E`, you can see two of them are coming from my app(because of `setSearchField` & `setFilteredMonsters`, the component will update for two times). 
Just two of them are coming from this weird different text file. We just need to ignore them because that's just strict mode.
