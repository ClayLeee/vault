`App` component is the highest level parent that can then in turn actually pass these props down to the corresponding correct children

### React Context
`React Context` allows us to `store our data somewhere` so that we don't have to go through this cumbersome process of passing all of the relevant data we get down from some kind of child all the way up to some common ancestor, and then from that ancestor prop drill down to all of the relevant and necessary child components or grandchild components that actually need this
