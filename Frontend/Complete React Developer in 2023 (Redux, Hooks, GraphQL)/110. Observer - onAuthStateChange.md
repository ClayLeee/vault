### Create an Authentication State Change Listener
firebase.utils.js
```js
import {
	...,
	onAuthStateChanged
} from 'firebase/auth';

export const onAuthStateChangedListener = (callback) => onAuthStateChanged(auth, callback);
```

user.content.jsx
```jsx
import { onAuthStateChangedListener } from '../utils/firebase/firebase.utils';

export const UserProvider = ({ children }) => {
	...
	useEffect(() => {
		const unsubscribe = onAuthStateChangedListener((user) => {
			console.log(user)
		})
	})
}
```

This listener is actually keeping track of whether or not the user has signed in or signed out using the different sign in and sign out methods that we have been calling, and it persists this between refreshes

### Remove Set Current User
sign-in-form.component.jsx
```jsx
const signInWithGoogle = async () => {
	const { user } = await signInWithGooglePopup();
-   setCurrentUser(user);
	await createUserDocumentFromAuth(user);
}

try {
	...
-   setCurrentUser(user);
}
```

We have a centralized place for all of these changes now. So what we are going to do is we are going to modify all of our code in order to now just allow this `one place to keep track of these references`
