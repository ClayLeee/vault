Hello everyone!  
  
One quick note about React 18 Strict Mode (the mode we generally always run React in!), for better debugging they've started doing a double invocation for certain things in a components lifecycle! If you see renders twice, this will be why! In React 17 `console.log` was automatically suppressed, but with React 18 they've stopped suppressing them.  
  
[You can read more about it here](https://reactjs.org/docs/strict-mode.html#detecting-unexpected-side-effects).  

But don't worry about it, you'll get used to seeing it really quickly!  
  
We'll discuss more about this in later videos, but in case anyone is concerned right away in the next few videos this will be why you see twice the number of logs.  
  
Happy coding!
