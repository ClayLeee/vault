We can actually ==visualize== the ==re-render== with a tool inside of ==Chrome DevTools==

### Add more examples: set title box
App.js
```jsx
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
import CardList from './components/card-list/card-list.component';
import SearchBox from './components/search-box/search-box.component';
import './App.css';

const App = () => {
	const [ searchField, setSearchField ] = useState('');
	const [ title, setTitle ] = useState('');
	const [ monsters, setMonsters ] = useState([]);
	const [ filteredMonsters, setFilteredMonsters ] = useState(monsters);

	useEffect(() => {
		fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users')
			.then((response) => response.json())
			.then((users) => setMonsters(users)
		);
	}, []);

	useEffect(() => {
		const newFilteredMonsters = monsters.filter((monster) => {
			return monster.name.toLocaleLowerCase().includes(searchField);
		});
		setFilteredMonsters(newFilteredMonsters);
	}, [monsters, searchField]);

	const onSearchChange = (event) => {
		const searchFieldString = event.target.value.toLocaleLowerCase();
		setSearchField(searchFieldString);
	};
	
	const onTitleChange = (event) => {
		const searchFieldString = event.target.value.toLocaleLowerCase();
		setTitle(searchFieldString);
	};

	return (
		<div className="App">
			<h1 className="app-title">{ title }</h1>
			<SearchBox
				className="monsters-search-box"
				onChangeHandler={ onSearchChange }
				placeholder="search monsters"
			/>
			<br />
			<SearchBox
				className="title-search-box"
				onChangeHandler={ onTitleChange }
				placeholder="set title"
			/>
			<CardList monsters={ filteredMonsters } />
		</div>
	)
}

export default App;
```

- ==Paint== is a terminology that is used by the DOM to determine what is actually being rendered or re-rendered onto the DOM itself. So when the DOM mounts nodes, modifies nodes or takes node off, that is all ==repainting==
- The process that we mentioned that is ==expensive for the DOM==, that is the ==painting process==
- Whenever components are being modified, you'll notice that they ==flash green==
- This ==paint flashing tool== can really ==visualize== the way that React determines how a component renders and which components we render

### Reflow
If we start typing into this title, we can notice that ==the first time I type== this ==entire page flashes green==, but ==every subsequent character== only modifies the ==actual title itself==

Why is this? 

The reason for this is because of ==Reflow==

- A component gets added onto the side, the DOM needs to ==reflow==
	- In this particular case, when the set title box is empty, the title has no height, even though the `h1` is still actually on the website
	- When we type the first time, the `h1` starts taking up height, what happens is that it needs to shift the entire page down because there is a now a new element that is taking up space on the DOM, and that is reflow
- When components are being mounted, there is this reflow going on, which is essentially a ==paint process==
- However, if everything is on the page and things are just being modified, you'll notice React will make sure to ==only modify the portions that are relevant==
