### Adding Google Fonts: open sans condensed
[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans)

index.html
```html
<head>
	...
	<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
	<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
	<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Bigelow+Rules&family=Open+Sans:wght@300&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
	<title>React App</title>
</head>
```

rename index.css to index.scss, and then modify the `font-family`
```css
body {
	margin: 0;
	font-family: 'Open Sans Condensed', sans-serif;
	-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
	-moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale;
}

code {
	font-family: source-code-pro, Menlo, Monaco, Consolas, 'Courier New',
	monospace;
}
```

index.js: modify the import file
```
- import './index.css';
+ import './index.scss';
```

- You can actually get CSS from the link, including ==font family==, ==font style==, ==font weight== and so on
- Google is giving us a CSS file that allows us to actually define what this `open sans condensed` is

### Sass

- CRA created and leverage the configuration so that it will take in the SASS that we've written and compile it down into CSS by the time it actually ends up in the browser
- The browser cannot read SASS, it can only read CSS

### package-lock.json vs yarn.lock
- yarn: `yarn.lock`
- npm: `package-lock.json`
- These lock files are essentially generated by our package managers and ==NPM or YARN== respectively in order to determine for an application what version of all of these ==DEPENDENCIES== that we have inside ==are locked to in this project==
- Lock file is a way for us to make sure that all of the Libraries that we use as a team are locked to the same versions, or at least compatible versions
- Typically you only need one: `yarn.lock` or `package-lock.json`
