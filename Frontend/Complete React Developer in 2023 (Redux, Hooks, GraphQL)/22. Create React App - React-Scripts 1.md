### React-Scripts
- Package.json In our Monsters-Rolodex project, there is a dependencies called "react-scripts"
	```json
	"dependencies": {
		"@testing-library/jest-dom": "^5.16.5",
		"@testing-library/react": "^13.4.0",
		"@testing-library/user-event": "^13.5.0",
		"react": "^18.2.0",
		"react-dom": "^18.2.0",
		"react-scripts": "5.0.1",
		"web-vitals": "^2.1.4"
	}
	```
- These React scripts are just different tools that help us leverage these new scripts that were generated for us: ==Start, Build, Test and Eject==
	```json
	"scripts": {
		"start": "react-scripts start",
		"build": "react-scripts build",
		"test": "react-scripts test",
		"eject": "react-scripts eject"
	}
	```
- React-Scripts is the kind of package helper that create React app, and what React-Scripts does is it helps us better build our application and develop against it using there four different commands
	- Start: It will take all of the files that we have written for our React application and it will ==run them in a local development environment==
	- Build: see [next lesson](23.%20Create%20React%20App%20-%20React-Scripts%202.md)
	- Test: see [next lesson](23.%20Create%20React%20App%20-%20React-Scripts%202.md)
	- Eject: see [next lesson](23.%20Create%20React%20App%20-%20React-Scripts%202.md)

### React's entry point in project - index.js
```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './index.css';
import App from './App';
import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
	<React.StrictMode>
		<App />
	</React.StrictMode>
);
```

#### React & ReactDOM
- In order for React to work, these two libraries are very critical
	- React: ==the engine== that runs how these applications get built
	- ReactDOM: ==the different tools== that helps us build web applications
	```jsx
	import React from 'react';
	import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
	```
- Other React related libraries for building out other things
	- React Native: for native mobile applications

#### Strict Mode
- Strict mode is going to add these additional checks and warnings that React says in case you're using old ==deprecated code==
```jsx
root.render(
	<React.StrictMode>
		<App />
	</React.StrictMode>
);
```

#### Root
- public/index.html has the id of ==root==, so what React is saying is, I want you to take that div and I want you to replace that div and render into our entire React application
```jsx
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
```
- React is ==just some way== for us to actually just build React applications into an HTML file, but that ==doesn't mean that all of the other HTML is not valid==
