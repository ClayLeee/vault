### Components
- A component is meant to tie together ==functionality== and ==visual representation of our user interface==
- It also aims to do is it aims to tie together ==reusable portions== of the code together into one segment

### Monsters Rolodex Components
For now,  we really only have two features.
1. A list of monsters
2. A search bar that searches through those monsters

We want to be able to build these reusable bits of code that we can use in multiple places. So we can seperate them by features like this.
