In the next video, we will finally deploy our application online. We will be using Git and Github to do this. However, if you have never used git and Github before, you may want to go to **Appendix 1: Key Developer Concepts** at the bottom of the course video player, and watch the videos titled _Git + Github_  and _Git + Github 2_. They are both videos from my other course [**The Complete Web Developer: Zero to Mastery**](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery/?referralCode=FFF295AECF3594CE440E) which I have decided to include for those that need them.  
  
Otherwise, let's keep going to the next video :)  

**By the way, just a heads up!**
  
Recently Github has decided to rename the original branch from `master` to `main` . If you want to find out the reason why they did this, you can read about it [here](https://github.com/github/renaming) (main is less offensive than master).  
  
_For this reason, for any new Github repositories created from now on _(old ones will stay the same with master as the main branch)_, you will have to use `main` instead of `master`. So anytime you see us use master when we are making changes to our master project, simply replace it with main for your own project!  
  
For example if you see a command like:  
`git push origin master`  
  
it should now be:  
`git push origin main`
