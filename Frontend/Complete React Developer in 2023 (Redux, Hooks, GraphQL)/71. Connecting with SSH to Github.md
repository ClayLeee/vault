One more note before continuing!

There are two ways to connect to a Github repository, through HTTPS and SSH. You can switch between the two options by clicking the switch https/ssh button after clicking clone. HTTPS does not require setup.

It is recommended by Github to clone using HTTPS according to their [official documentation here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/which-remote-url-should-i-use). However, if you do end up using SSH and have never set it up before, there are a couple steps you must take first!

Firstly, SSH is like a unique fingerprint you generate for your computer in your terminal, which you then let your github account know about so it knows that requests from this computer using SSH (cloning/ pushing/ pulling) are safe to do.

  

In order to generate an SSH, please follow the instructions here [https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent](https://help.github.com/en/enterprise/2.15/user/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)

  

There are Mac and Windows options, so choose the one that's right for you.

**As for deploying our website goes, hang on tight until later in our Capstone project where we'll learn how to deploy with Netlify in as easy as 5 minutes!**
